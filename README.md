# Game technical route 
=========
  We used Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe illustrator, Adobe After Effects as tools to create vivid game materials, and used **Cocos Creator framework** and integrated development environment to develop game programs in TypeScript language. Cocos Creator has convenient visual interface, debugging tools and its release are visible in the browser in real time and it has many other good features. Games developed through Cocos Creator can be quickly deployed to a web platform accessible to all players. During the development process, we made the attack animation, movement and attack logic, deployment unit logic and clearance logic, and adjusted the numerical balance of the game.

# Website technical route
=========
  We mainly used the following open source tools and frameworks in the develotment of the website:

  For the front-end of the website, we used **Vue**, a progressive framework for building user interfaces, ElementsUI, a front-end component library based on the Vue framework, and a browser-based dynamic JavaScript visualization library Vis.js for data visualization.

  For the back-end of the website, we used the **SpringBoot** framework based on the **JavaEE** ecology to design and implement the business logic and the database interaction. SpringBoot has the characteristics of rapid development and is particularly suitable for building micro-service systems. It encapsulates some frequently used components and tools to facilitate external output of various forms of services. It has a very simple integration of security policies and supports relational and non-relational databases. It upports embedded containers such as Tomcat during runtime. It has a powerful development package which supports hot starting, automatically managing dependencies, application monitoring, and various IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA.

  In the database layer, we used **MySql**, a relational database system to store website data. MySQL is smaller in size and faster in command execution compared with other database systems. It is an open source software and provides a free version of application. Compared with other large database system settings and management, it is less complex and easier to use. It has strong portability and can run on a variety of system platforms. 

  In terms of deployment, we use **Nginx** and **Tomcat** as the proxy layer for the above services and deploy them on the Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service based on the **Ubuntu** environment to provide support for the operation of the website. The cloud elastic compute service provides more stable, secure, and highly resilient network services, which can be expanded flexibly according to the business requirements. It also can be dynamically migrated with high reliability.

  During the development process, we also used the following tools: front-end development and debugging tool **Visual Studio Code**, API testing tool Postman, back-end development and debugging tool: IntelliJ IDEA, database development and debugging tool: Navicat, team collaboration tool Feishu, version control tool Git and code hosting tool GitHub.
